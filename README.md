# NLP_News_Classification
This project is focused on NLP - News Classification. It utilizes various natural language processing techniques and deep - learning models to classify news articles.

## Structure
Bert: A sub - directory potentially for Bert - related code, models, or pre - training logs.
code: Contains Jupyter notebooks for different solution approaches, such as EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), fastText, traditional machine learning (ML), TextCNN, and TextRNN.
data: Presumably stores the datasets used for training and testing.
emb: Likely for word embeddings.
model: Holds the trained models.
preprocess: For data pre - processing code.
rank4_NLP_textclassification: Could be related to a specific ranking or classification task.
result: Stores the classification results.
This project provides a comprehensive framework for news classification in the NLP domain, integrating multiple methods and techniques for efficient and accurate classification.
